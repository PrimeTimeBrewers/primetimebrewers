### Life is Easier than Ever  

Life is short and hard, like a bodybuilding elf.  But, it keeps getting better for the Homebrewer!  The hobby has grown so much and gotten so much easier, anybody can win that Brewer of the Year plaque these days.  We have come a long way just in the last decade.   
 
When I started brewing 15 years ago, (I know, I am but an infant compared to many of our members) the beerscape was quite different.  I won’t get into how different because that could be a topic for another day.  Craft beer was nearly non-existent compared to now.  Many homebrewers started out of necessity as much as curiosity.   
 
I remember those bleak, colorless, pre-dawn mornings getting the fire ablaze before making the harrowing trek to the well, a mere 15 miles uphill both ways.

Oh the doors had been thrown wide and the horizon was spread before me.  This was the first breakthrough to modern brewing.  I am sure there are many members that remember when fire and pottery were outlandish innovations.  Look how far we have come since those dark times. 
 
But seriously, Homebrewing has never been easier.  It has always been a DYI style of hobby. People that like to make something out of nothing.  We scavenge parts, and repurpose equipment to meet our needs.  Not too long ago ingredients were much more limited in variety, quality, and availability. I recently paged through Midwest Supply catalog that I received in the mail, and was struck by how...
